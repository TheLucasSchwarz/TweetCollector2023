#### Description
Download tweets for a huge number of accounts with Twitter-API and R using the academictwitteR-Package.

### The Project
With this Project you are able to collect tweets for a specific time period for 2500 twitter accounts. 
All you need is a dataset with the Twitterhandles of the accounts your interested in.
If you want to collect tweets from more twitter accounts at once, you have to adjust this template or run it multiple times.

### Whats the use of this template?
During restrictions of Twitters Academic Developer Access, you are only allowed to collect tweets for few accounts at once. This script splits up our querys and makes the process of downloading tweets from a huge amount of accounts more convinient.

### What do I need?
All you need is an Twitter Academic Developer Access and R installed on your computer. 

### Who you are?
My name is Lucas Schwarz, I'm a master student in Empirical Democarcy Studies at the University of Mainz with a B.A. in Political Science. 
I'm interested in Political Communication, Political Sociology and many field related to Politics and Internet. I'm a Stata user who is learning R right now.

### Your knowledge is welcome!
Because I'm a beginner in R, I appreciate your contributions and suggestion to make this code more elegant and optimised.

### Thanks for using my Template. Feel free to share it :)
