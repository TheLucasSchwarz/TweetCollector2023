### Description
Download tweets for many accounts with Twitter-API and R using the academictwitteR-Package.

### The Project
With this project, you can collect tweets for a specific time period for 2500 Twitter accounts. 
All you need is a dataset with the Twitter handles of the accounts you are interested in.
If you want to collect tweets from more Twitter accounts at once, you have to adjust this template or run it multiple times.

### What’s the use of this template?
Because there are restrictions in Twitter’s Academic Developer Access, you can only collect tweets for a few accounts at once. This script splits up your queries and makes the process of downloading tweets from a considerable amount of accounts more convenient.

### What do I need?
All you need is Twitter’s Academic Developer Access and R installed on your computer. 

### Who are you?
My name is Lucas Schwarz, and I’m a master’s student in Empirical Democracy Studies at the University of Mainz with a B.A. in Political Science. 
I'm interested in Political Communication, Political Sociology, and many fields related to Politics and Internet. I'm a Stata user who is learning R right now.

### Your knowledge is welcome!
Because I'm a beginner in R, I appreciate your contributions and suggestion to make this code more elegant and optimized.

### Thanks for using my Template. Feel free to share :)
